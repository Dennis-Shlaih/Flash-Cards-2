# Web Development Project 3 - *Flash-Cards-2*

Submitted by: **Dennis Shlaih**

This web app: **Flash-Cards is an interactive flashcard quiz designed to help users test their knowledge in topics like Discrete Mathematics. Users can navigate through a set of flashcards using Next, Back, and Shuffle buttons, enter their answers for each question, and receive instant feedback on their responses. The app tracks and displays the user's current streak of correct answers and their longest streak, making the learning experience more engaging.**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

## Challenges

- [X] Managing the state of the input field and ensuring it updated dynamically with user interactions was challenging. Additionally, preventing the form from automatically resetting after a submission required attention to React state management.
- [X] Arranging the navigation buttons (Next, Back, Shuffle, Submit) and making them functional.
- [X] Ensuring the user's input was properly captured and accurately compared with the correct answer.
